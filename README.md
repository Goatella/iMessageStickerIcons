# iMessageStickerIcons

You need a lot of differnt icons sizes when submitting an app.

This script quickly resizes a an image (I start with 1024x768) to all of the sizes needed for iMessage extention apps.

This is based off of the script found here: http://chaosinmotion.com/blog/?p=859

HOW TO USE:

Open terminal

CD desktop (or wherever you have the script saved)

./icons.sh path/to/your/image.png
